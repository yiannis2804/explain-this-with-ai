# Explain This with AI

**Explain This with AI** is a Chrome Extension that allows users to highlight any text on a webpage, right-click, and receive a simplified explanation powered by OpenAI's GPT model. The backend is a Flask server hosted on Render, and the frontend is a lightweight Chrome extension.

## 📌 Features

- 🌐 Chrome Extension for contextual interaction
- 🔁 Right-click context menu to trigger explanation
- 🧠 Backend powered by OpenAI GPT (via API)
- 🌍 Flask server deployed to Render
- 🔐 API key secured via environment variable

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User Action**: Highlight any text in Chrome and right-click → "Explain This".
2. **Chrome Extension**: Sends the selected text as a POST request to the Flask backend.
3. **Flask Backend**: Receives the request and sends a prompt to OpenAI's API.
4. **Response**: The simplified explanation is returned and displayed to the user.
